# multi-user-encryption
prototype of how encryption could work for multiple users

1. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Load sample data: python sampledata.py
3. Run server: python app.py
4. Run test script: python tester.py

Look at tester.py to see how data is encrypted and decrypted with multiple users using different keys. There is also a /rotate endpoint to change the keys.
